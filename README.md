* First commit was made and more updates will be made in the future. Use the README file to track your changes and make additional comments so we have a place
hold ourselves accountable and show others that we haven't been lazy. Let's try and have some commits from each of us **EVERY** day. Remember, our deadline is set for **Friday November 23rd**.

* Changed some things around with how the project is built. When I imported the project on my Mac I found out that I did not update my
JRE and Javac. Make sure you do as well.
* Imported [Michael Riha](https://github.com/michaelriha)'s and [Akshat Kukreti](https://github.com/akshatk)'s code that we need to use for analyzing the pdf files. Their source code can be found [here](https://github.com/michaelriha/WASC-Essay).
